# Bank-Data-Analysis

This repository contains the code used to analyze a bank marketing dataset to gain insights into customer behavior and preferences. The analysis was performed using Python 3.

### PART 2:

In the data visualization section, there are three plots created to visualize different attributes of the bank dataset. One-hot encoding was used to convert categorical features into numerical data, to be able to directly handle categorical data. No missing values were present in the dataset, but if there were, we could replace the missing values with the mean or median value of the column or using more advanced imputation techniques.

### PART 3:

The analysis explored various questions related to bank marketing campaigns. By applying different classification techniques to the dataset, the author gained insights into customer behavior and preferences. The effectiveness of the marketing campaigns was explored by analyzing the confusion matrices of the different classification techniques. The impact of different customer attributes on the likelihood of subscribing to a term deposit was also explored by visualizing different attributes of the dataset.

Overall, the bank dataset provided valuable insights into customer behavior and preferences, and the different classification techniques allowed for exploration of a range of questions related to marketing effectiveness and customer segmentation. By using machine learning techniques to analyze the data, we were able to gain a deeper understanding of the factors that influence customer behavior and make data-driven decisions to improve marketing campaigns.

The code in this repository can serve as a starting point for those interested in analyzing marketing datasets and can be easily adapted to other datasets.
